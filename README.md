### Packages
#### What Is The Tailwind?
A utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center, and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup (HTML or JSX)
#### Why I used Tailwind For Styling?
* the main reason to use Tailwind is to learn and try it. I used Bootstrap for some projects but didn't like it,
because when you want to style something with a specific scale like font-size: 60rem, you can't do that because Bootstrap limits you in static classes.
so, I want to use Tailwind and liked it. 
it provides a lot of classes than Bootstrap and if you want to style something with a specific scale and there is no class for that you can make your own class or use 
Tailwind with "**[amount you want]**" like "w-[32rem]".
* You donâ€™t need to think about class names
* No jumping between files to write markup and styles
